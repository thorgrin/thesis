  Abstract                 = {At present, accurate traffic classification usually requires the use of deep packet inspection to analyse packet payload. This requires significant CPU and memory resources and are invasive of network user privacy. In this paper, we propose an alternative traffic classification approach that is lightweight and
 only examines the first four bytes of packet payload observed in each direction. We have implemented as an open-source library called libprotoident, which we evaluate by comparing its performance against existing traffic classifiers that use deep packet inspection. Our results show that our approach offers comparable (if not better) accuracy than tools that have access to full packet payload, yet requires less processing resources and is more acceptable, from a privacy standpoint, to network operators and users.},

  Abstract                 = {Packet sampling methods such as Cisco's NetFlow are widely employed by large networks to reduce the amount of traffic data measured. A key problem with packet sampling is that it is inherently a lossy process, discarding (potentially useful) information. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the impact of sampling on anomaly detection metrics. Starting with unsampled flow records collected during the Blaster worm outbreak, we reconstruct the underlying packet trace and simulate packet sampling at increasing rates. We then use our knowledge of the Blaster anomaly to build a baseline of normal traffic (without Blaster), against which we can measure the anomaly size at various sampling rates. This approach allows us to evaluate the impact of packet sampling on anomaly detection without being restricted to (or biased by) a particular anomaly detection method.We find that packet sampling does not disturb the anomaly size when measured in volume metrics such as the number of bytes and number of packets, but grossly biases the number of flows. However, we find that recently proposed entropy-based summarizations of packet and flow counts are affected less by sampling, and expose the Blaster worm outbreak even at higher sampling rates. Our findings suggest that entropy summarizations are more resilient to sampling than volume metrics. Thus, while not perfect, sampling still preserves sufficient distributional structure, which when harnessed by tools like entropy, can expose hard-to-detect scanning anomalies.},

  Abstract                 = {Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the state-of-the-art technology for traffic classification. According to the conventional wisdom, DPI is the most accurate classification technique. Consequently, most popular products, either commercial or open-source, rely on some sort of DPI for traffic classification. However, the actual performance of DPI is still unclear to the research community, since the lack of public datasets prevent the comparison and reproducibility of their results. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of 6 well-known DPI tools, which are commonly used in the traffic classification literature. Our study includes 2 commercial products (PACE and NBAR) and 4 open-source tools (OpenDPI, L7-filter, nDPI, and Libprotoident). We studied their performance in various scenarios (including packet and flow truncation) and at different classification levels (application protocol, application and web service). We carefully built a labeled dataset with more than 750 K flows, which contains traffic from popular applications. We used the Volunteer-Based System (VBS), developed at Aalborg University, to guarantee the correct labeling of the dataset. We released this dataset, including full packet payloads, to the research community. We believe this dataset could become a common benchmark for the comparison and validation of network traffic classifiers. Our results present PACE, a commercial tool, as the most accurate solution. Surprisingly, we find that some open-source tools, such as nDPI and Libprotoident, also achieve very high accuracy.},

Such popularity has resulted in an increase of the amount of resources consumed in backbone links, whose capacities have witnessed numerous upgrades to cope with the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth. Consequently, network traffic processing at today‚Äôs data transmission rates is a very demanding task, which has been traditionally accomplished by means of specialized hardware tailored to specific tasks. However, such approaches lack either of flexibility or extensibility‚Äîor both. As an alternative, the research community has pointed to the utilization of commodity hardware, which may provide flexible and extensible cost-aware solutions, ergo entailing large reductions of the operational and capital expenditure investments. In this chapter, we provide a survey-like introduction to high-performance network traffic processing using commodity hardware. We present the required background to understand the different solutions proposed in the literature to achieve high-speed lossless packet capture, which are reviewed and compared.},

  Abstract                 = {Flow monitoring has become a prevalent method for monitoring traffic in high-speed networks. By focusing on the analysis of flows, rather than individual packets, it is often said to be more scalable than traditional packet-based traffic analysis. Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early nineties into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future. We show, for example, how the previously opposing approaches of Deep Packet Inspection and flow monitoring have been united into novel monitoring approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present an analysis of HTTP traffic in a large-scale environment which uses network flow monitoring extended by parsing HTTP requests. In contrast to previously published analyses, we were the first to classify patterns of HTTP traffic which are relevant to network security. We described three classes of HTTP traffic which contain brute-force password attacks, connections to proxies, HTTP scanners, and web crawlers. Using the classification, we were able to detect up to 16 previously undetectable brute-force password attacks and 19 HTTP scans per day in our campus network. The activity of proxy servers and web crawlers was also observed. Symptoms of these attacks may be detected by other methods based on traditional flow monitoring, but detection using the analysis of HTTP requests is more straightforward. We, thus, confirm the added value of extended flow monitoring in comparison to the traditional method.},

  Abstract                 = {With the widespread use of encrypted data transport, network traffic encryption is becoming a standard nowadays. This presents a challenge for traffic measurement, especially for analysis and anomaly detection methods, which are dependent on the type of network traffic. In this paper, we survey existing approaches for classification and analysis of encrypted traffic. First, we describe the most widespread encryption protocols used throughout the Internet. We show that the initiation of an encrypted connection and the protocol structure give away much information for encrypted traffic classification and analysis. Then, we survey payload and feature-based classification methods for encrypted traffic and categorize them using an established taxonomy. The advantage of some of described classification methods is the ability to recognize the encrypted application protocol in addition to the encryption protocol. Finally, we make a comprehensive comparison of the surveyed feature-based classification methods and present their weaknesses and strengths.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring of high-speed networks is becoming a resource intensive task. There are dedicated flow monitoring probes built with commodity hardware support up to 10G links, but multiple 10G or even 100 G optical networks are being used for transport networks and a data center connectivity. Running and maintaining many separate probes is uneconomical and time-consuming. Therefore, we explore the possibility to facilitate network interface cards (NICs) with multiple 10G interfaces to build probes which can replace many existing boxes, leading to reduced management and operational costs. The monitoring performance is critical for such a high-density solution. We use two custom-built, FPGA-based NICs, each with eight 10G interfaces to test current CPU limits and to propose improvements for the near future commodity NICs.},
