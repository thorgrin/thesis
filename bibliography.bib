  Abstract                 = {In the previous years, Skype has gained more and more popularity, since it is seen as the best VoIP software with good quality of sound, ease of use and one that works everywhere and with every OS. Because of its great diffusion, both the operators and the users are, for different reasons, interested in
detecting Skype traffic.
In this paper we propose a real-time algorithm (named Skype-Hunter) to detect and classify Skype traffic. In more detail, this novel method, by means of both signature-based and statistical procedures, is able to correctly reveal and classify the signaling traffic as well as the data traffic (calls and file transfers). To assess the effectiveness of the algorithm, experimental tests have been performed with several traffic data sets, collected in different network scenarios. Our system outperforms the ‘classical’ statistical traffic classifiers as well as the state-of-the-art ad hoc Skype classifier.},

  Abstract                 = {When browsers report TLS errors, they cannot distinguish between attacks and harmless server misconfigurations; hence they leave it to the user to decide whether continuing is safe. However, actual attacks remain rare. As a result, users quickly become used to "false positives" that deplete their attention span, making it unlikely that they will pay sufficient scrutiny when a real attack comes along. Consequently, browser vendors should aim to minimize the number of low-risk warnings they report. To guide that process, we perform a large-scale measurement study of common TLS warnings. Using a set of passive network monitors located at different sites, we identify the prevalence of warnings for a total population of about 300,000 users over a nine-month period. We identify low-risk scenarios that consume a large chunk of the user attention budget and make concrete recommendations to browser vendors that will help maintain user attention in high-risk situations. We study the impact on end users with a data set much larger in scale than the data sets used in previous TLS measurement studies. A key novelty of our approach involves the use of internal browser code instead of generic TLS libraries for analysis, providing more accurate and representative results.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of machine learning is to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem. Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. In order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions, it discusses many methods from different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The text covers such topics as supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, and reinforcement learning. New to the second edition are chapters on kernel machines, graphical models, and Bayesian estimation; expanded coverage of statistical tests in a chapter on design and analysis of machine learning experiments; case studies available on the Web (with downloadable results for instructors); and many additional exercises. All chapters have been revised and updated. Introduction to Machine Learning can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods. Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series},

Flow feature set is calculated from one or more packets for each flow. RIPPER and C4.5 classification algorithms are used to compare selected feature sets. The C4.5 classifier showed better results in detection rate and false positive rate. The results provided by both feature sets seems to be comparable.

Pre-processing is applied to the traffic data to express as traffic flows. Results of 10-fold cross validation for each learning algorithm indicate that a detection rate of 99\% and a false positive rate of 0.7\% can be achieved using RIPPER. Moreover, promising preliminary results were obtained when RIPPER was employed to identify which service was running over SSH.

  Abstract                 = {Previously, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) detected intrusions by comparing the behaviour of the network to the pre-defined rules or pre-observed network traffic, which was expensive in terms of both cost and time. Unsupervised machine learning techniques have overcome these issues and can detect unknown and complex attacks within normal or encrypted communication without any prior knowledge. NIDS monitors bytes, packets and network flow to detect intrusions. It is nearly impossible to monitor the payload of all packets in a high-speed network. On the other hand, the content of packets does not have sufficient information to detect a complex attack. Since the rate of attacks within encrypted communication is increasing and the content of encrypted packets is not accessible to NIDS, it has been suggested to monitor network flows. As most network intrusions spread within the network very quickly, in this paper we will propose a new real-time unsupervised NIDS for detecting new and complex attacks within normal and encrypted communications. To achieve having a real-time NIDS, the proposed model should capture live network traffic from different sensors and analyse specific metrics such as number of bytes, packets, network flows, and the time explicitly and implicitly, of packets and network flows, in the different resolutions. The NIDS will flag the time slot as an anomaly if any of those metrics passes the threshold, and it will send the time slot to the first engine. The first engine clusters different layers and dimensions of the network's behaviour and correlates the outliers to purge the intrusions from normal traffic. Detecting network attacks, which produce a huge amount of network traffic (e.g. DOS, DDOS, scanning) was the aim of proposing the first engine. Analysing statistics of network flows increases the feasibility of detecting intrusions within encrypted communications. The aim of proposing the second engine is to conduct a deeper analysis a- d correlate the traffic and behaviour of Bots (current attackers) during DDOS attacks to find the Bot-Master.},

The methods are subject to several tests using different export options, feature sets, and training and test traffic traces for a total of 128 different configurations. Of particular interest are test cases which that use a test set from a different network than that which the model was trained on, i.e. robustness of the trained models. Results show that the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) based trained model is able to achieve the best performance among the three methods when each approach is tested on traffic traces that are captured on the same network as the training network trace. On the other hand, C4.5 achieved the best results among the three methods when tested on traffic traces which are captured on totally different networks than the training trace. Furthermore, it is shown that continuous sampling of the training data is no better than random sampling, but the training data is very important for how well the classifiers will perform on traffic traces captured from different networks. Moreover, the C4.5 based approach provides the fastest and the most human readable model, whereas the MOGA reduces the complexity of the k-means clustering algorithm tremendously.},

This work explores the use of a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) for both, feature selection and cluster count optimization, for an unsupervised machine learning technique, K-Means, applied to encrypted traffic identification. Specifically, a hierarchical K-Means algorithm is employed, comparing its performance to the MOGA with a non-hierarchical (flat) K-Means algorithm. The latter has already been benchmarked against common unsupervised techniques found in the literature, where results have favored the proposed MOGA. The purpose of this paper is to explore the gains, if any, obtained by increasing cluster purity in the proposed model by means of a second layer of clusters. In this work, SSH is chosen as an example of an encrypted application. However, nothing prevents the proposed model to work with other types of encrypted traffic, such as SSL or Skype.

In particular, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) libraries such as OpenSSL are widely available and can easily be used to encrypt any type of traffic. In this paper, we propose a method to detect applications in SSL encrypted connections. Our method uses only the size of the first few packets of an SSL connection to recognize the application, which enables an early classification. We test our method on packet traces collected on two campus networks and on manually-encrypted traces.

The method then searches for first data packet in the connection and uses the same clustering on data packet sizes to detect underlying application.

  Abstract                 = {Packet sampling methods such as Cisco's NetFlow are widely employed by large networks to reduce the amount of traffic data measured. A key problem with packet sampling is that it is inherently a lossy process, discarding (potentially useful) information. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the impact of sampling on anomaly detection metrics. Starting with unsampled flow records collected during the Blaster worm outbreak, we reconstruct the underlying packet trace and simulate packet sampling at increasing rates. We then use our knowledge of the Blaster anomaly to build a baseline of normal traffic (without Blaster), against which we can measure the anomaly size at various sampling rates. This approach allows us to evaluate the impact of packet sampling on anomaly detection without being restricted to (or biased by) a particular anomaly detection method.We find that packet sampling does not disturb the anomaly size when measured in volume metrics such as the number of bytes and number of packets, but grossly biases the number of flows. However, we find that recently proposed entropy-based summarizations of packet and flow counts are affected less by sampling, and expose the Blaster worm outbreak even at higher sampling rates. Our findings suggest that entropy summarizations are more resilient to sampling than volume metrics. Thus, while not perfect, sampling still preserves sufficient distributional structure, which when harnessed by tools like entropy, can expose hard-to-detect scanning anomalies.},

  Abstract                 = {Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the state-of-the-art technology for traffic classification. According to the conventional wisdom, DPI is the most accurate classification technique. Consequently, most popular products, either commercial or open-source, rely on some sort of DPI for traffic classification. However, the actual performance of DPI is still unclear to the research community, since the lack of public datasets prevent the comparison and reproducibility of their results. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of 6 well-known DPI tools, which are commonly used in the traffic classification literature. Our study includes 2 commercial products (PACE and NBAR) and 4 open-source tools (OpenDPI, L7-filter, nDPI, and Libprotoident). We studied their performance in various scenarios (including packet and flow truncation) and at different classification levels (application protocol, application and web service). We carefully built a labeled dataset with more than 750 K flows, which contains traffic from popular applications. We used the Volunteer-Based System (VBS), developed at Aalborg University, to guarantee the correct labeling of the dataset. We released this dataset, including full packet payloads, to the research community. We believe this dataset could become a common benchmark for the comparison and validation of network traffic classifiers. Our results present PACE, a commercial tool, as the most accurate solution. Surprisingly, we find that some open-source tools, such as nDPI and Libprotoident, also achieve very high accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {The area of Internet traffic measurement has advanced enormously over the last couple of years. This was mostly due to the increase in network access speeds, due to the appearance of bandwidth-hungry applications, due to the ISPs' increased interest in precise user traffic profile information and also a response to the enormous growth in the number of connected users. These changes greatly affected the work of Internet service providers and network administrators, which have to deal with increasing resource demands and abrupt traffic changes brought by new applications. This survey explains the main techniques and problems known in the field of IP traffic analysis and focuses on application detection. First, it separates traffic analysis into packet-based and flow-based categories and details the advantages and problems for each approach. Second, this work cites the techniques for traffic analysis accessible in the literature, along with the analysis performed by the authors. Relevant techniques include signature-matching, sampling and inference. Third, this work shows the trends in application classification analysis and presents important and recent references in the subject. Lastly, this survey draws the readers' interest to open research topics in the area of traffic analysis and application detection and makes some final remarks.},

Over the past 10 years the research community and the networking industry have investigated, proposed and developed several classification approaches. While traffic classification techniques are improving in accuracy and efficiency, the continued proliferation of different Internet application behaviors, in addition to growing incentives to disguise some applications to avoid filtering or blocking, are among the reasons that traffic classification remains one of many open problems in Internet research. In this article we review recent achievements and discuss future directions in traffic classification, along with their trade-offs in applicability, reliability, and privacy. We outline the persistently unsolved challenges in the field over the last decade, and suggest several strategies for tackling these challenges to promote progress in the science of Internet traffic classification.},

  Abstract                 = {Attackers disguise their activities in order to evade detection and circumvent network security measures. The work presented in this document builds upon earlier work on traffic profiling to reveal the nature of a flow based on its behaviour. An important step, which is the focus of the document, consists of identifying relevant and discriminative flow attributes for use in traffic characterization. We have developed a number of indicators that portray essential communication dynamics, based solely on information that can be gathered from monitoring packet headers. The indicators are lightweight and the characteristics measured can be interpreted from domain knowledge. A tool is under development at the Communications Research Centre Canada to demonstrate the relevance of the flow attributes in characterizing network traffic. In particular, the tool includes the capability to describe the traffic and recognize a number of ubiquitous protocols. Several of the protocols we experimented with are in essence very similar, but were found to be distinguishable with the indicators presented herein. Preliminary assessment shows us that the derived tool is useful as is, and may lead with further research to a number of applications.},

This paper covers the design and implementation of nDPI, an open-source library for protocol classification using both packet header and payload. nDPI was extensively validated in various monitoring projects ranging from Linux kernel protocol classification, to analysis of 10 Gbit traffic, reporting both high protocol detection accuracy and efficiency.},

However, for the characteristic of bandwidth-intensive, P2P traffic identification is especially important in network management, which has been a hot topic in recent years. Based on the review of shortages of current existed technologies, a k-means algorithm based method was brought forward to identify the P2P traffic. For the reason that K-Means is one of the quickest and simplest clustering methods, it was selected as the core algorithm. In addition, the process of flow-information extraction and the descriptions of selected traffic attribute were also introduced in detail. Since the BT file-sharing traffic mainly runs over TCP, we only extract the flow-information of TCP connections. Finally, the experiments on 3 common used P2P applications, which are BitTorrent, BitSpirit and eMule, demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the method.},

  Abstract                 = {Internet traffic classification has been the subject of intensive study since the birth of the Internet itself. Indeed, the evolution of approaches for traffic classification can be associated with the evolution of the Internet itself and with the adoption of new services and the emergence of novel applications and communication paradigms. Throughout the years many approaches have been proposed for addressing technical issues imposed by such novel services. Deep-Packet Inspection (DPI) has been a very important research topic within the traffic classification field and its concept consists of the analysis of the contents of the captured packets in order to accurately and timely discriminate the traffic generated by different Internet protocols. DPI was devised as a means to address several issues associated with port-based and statistical-based classification approaches in order to achieve an accurate and timely traffic classification. Many research works proposed different DPI schemes while many open-source modules have also become available for deployment. Surveys become then valuable tools for performing an overall analysis, study and comparison between the several proposed methods. In this paper we present a survey in which a complete and thorough analysis of the most important open-source DPI modules is performed. Such analysis comprises an evaluation of the classification accuracy, through a common set of traffic traces with ground truth, and of the computational requirements. In this manner, this survey presents a technical assessment of DPI modules and the analysis of the obtained evaluation results enable the proposal of general guidelines for the design and implementation of more adequate DPI modules.},

Consequently, network traffic processing at today’s data transmission rates is a very demanding task, which has been traditionally accomplished by means of specialized hardware tailored to specific tasks. However, such approaches lack either of flexibility or extensibility—or both. As an alternative, the research community has pointed to the utilization of commodity hardware, which may provide flexible and extensible cost-aware solutions, ergo entailing large reductions of the operational and capital expenditure investments. In this chapter, we provide a survey-like introduction to high-performance network traffic processing using commodity hardware.

  Abstract                 = {SSH attacks are a main area of concern for network managers, due to the danger associated with a successful compromise. Detecting these attacks, and possibly compromised victims, is therefore a crucial activity. Most existing network intrusion detection systems designed for this purpose rely on the inspection of individual packets and, hence, do not scale to today’s high-speed networks. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes SSHCure, a flow-based intrusion detection system for SSH attacks. It employs an efficient algorithm for the real-time detection of ongoing attacks and allows identification of compromised attack targets. A prototype implementation of the algorithm, including a graphical user interface, is implemented as a plugin for the popular NfSen monitoring tool. Finally, the detection performance of the system is validated with empirical traffic data.},

  Abstract                 = {Flow monitoring has become a prevalent method for monitoring traffic in high-speed networks. By focusing on the analysis of flows, rather than individual packets, it is often said to be more scalable than traditional packet-based traffic analysis. Flow monitoring embraces the complete chain of packet observation, flow export using protocols such as NetFlow and IPFIX, data collection, and data analysis. In contrast to what is often assumed, all stages of flow monitoring are closely intertwined. Each of these stages therefore has to be thoroughly understood, before being able to perform sound flow measurements. Otherwise, flow data artifacts and data loss can be the consequence, potentially without being observed. This paper is the first of its kind to provide an integrated tutorial on all stages of a flow monitoring setup. As shown throughout this paper, flow monitoring has evolved from the early nineties into a powerful tool, and additional functionality will certainly be added in the future. We show, for example, how the previously opposing approaches of Deep Packet Inspection and flow monitoring have been united into novel monitoring approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {The SSL and TLS infrastructure used in important protocols like HTTPs and IMAPs is built on an X.509 public-key infrastructure (PKI). X.509 certificates are thus used to authenticate services like online banking, shopping, e-mail, etc. However, it always has been felt that the certification processes of this PKI may lack in stringency, resulting in a deployment where many certificates do not meet the requirements of a secure PKI. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of X.509 certificates in the wild. To shed more light on the state of the deployed and actually used X.509 PKI, we obtained and evaluated data from many different sources. We conducted HTTPs scans of a large number of popular HTTPs servers over a 1.5-year time span, including scans from nine locations distributed over the globe. To compare certification properties of highly ranked hosts with the global picture, we included a third-party scan of the entire IPv4 space in our analyses. Furthermore, we monitored live SSL/TLS traffic on a 10Gbps uplink of a large research network. This allows us to compare the properties of the deployed PKI with the part of the PKI that is being actively accessed by users. Our analysis reveals that the quality of certification lacks in stringency, due to a number of reasons among which incorrect certification chains or invalid certificate subjects give the most cause for concern. Similar concerns can be raised for the properties of certification chains and many self-signed certificates used in the deployed X.509 PKI. Our findings confirm what has long been believed -- namely that the X.509 PKI we often use in our everyday's lives is in a sorry state.},

Their results indicate that using forward secrecy is no harder, and can even be faster using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), than no forward secrecy.},

In contrast to previously published analyses, we were the first to classify patterns of HTTP traffic which are relevant to network security. We described three classes of HTTP traffic which contain brute-force password attacks, connections to proxies, HTTP scanners, and web crawlers. Using the classification, we were able to detect up to 16 previously undetectable brute-force password attacks and 19 HTTP scans per day in our campus network. The activity of proxy servers and web crawlers was also observed. Symptoms of these attacks may be detected by other methods based on traditional flow monitoring, but detection using the analysis of HTTP requests is more straightforward. We, thus, confirm the added value of extended flow monitoring in comparison to the traditional method.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a fundamentally different approach to classifying traffic flows according to the applications that generate them. In contrast to previous methods, our approach is based on observing and identifying patterns of host behavior at the transport layer. We analyze these patterns at three levels of increasing detail (i) the social, (ii) the functional and (iii) the application level. This multilevel approach of looking at traffic flow is probably the most important contribution of this paper. Furthermore, our approach has two important features. First, it operates in the dark, having (a) no access to packet payload, (b) no knowledge of port numbers and (c) no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. These restrictions respect privacy, technological and practical constraints. Second, it can be tuned to balance the accuracy of the classification versus the number of successfully classified traffic flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three real traces. Our results show that we are able to classify 80\%-90\% of the traffic with more than 95\% accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper concerns the fundamental problem of identifying the content nature of a flow-namely text, binary, or encrypted-for the first time. We propose Iustitia, a framework for identifying flow nature on the fly. The key observation behind Iustitia is that text flows have the lowest entropy and encrypted flows have the highest entropy, while the entropy of binary flows stands in between. We further extend Iustitia for the finer-grained classification of binary flows so that we can differentiate different types of binary flows (such as image, video, and executables) and even the file formats (such as JPEG and GIF for images, MPEG and AVI for videos) carried by binary flows. The basic idea of Iustitia is to classify flows using machine learning techniques where a feature is the entropy of every certain number of consecutive bytes. Our experimental results show that the classification can be done with high speed and high accuracy. On average, Iustitia can classify flows with 88.27\% of accuracy using a buffer size of 1 K with a classification time of less than 10\% of packet interarrival time for 91.2\% of flows.},

The steady emergence of new Internet applications, together with the use of encryption and obfuscation techniques, ensures that traffic classification remains a hot research topic. Much research has been devoted to this topic by the research community in the last decade. However, an optimal traffic classification model has yet to be defined. Many techniques and formats have been described, with the current literature therefore lacking appropriate benchmarks expressed in a consistent terminology. Moreover, existing surveys are outdated and do not include many recent advances in the field. In this article, we present a systematic multilevel taxonomy that covers a broad range of existing and recently proposed methods, together with examples of vendor classification techniques. Our taxonomy assists in defining a consistent terminology. It could be useful in future benchmarking contexts by characterizing and comparing methods at three different levels. From this perspective, we describe key features and provide design hints for future classification models, while emphasizing the main requirements for promoting future research efforts. To motivate researchers and other interested parties, we collect and share data captured from real traffic, using two models to protect data privacy. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This fragmented approach to traffic classification research leaves the operational community with no basis for consensus on what approach to use when, and how to interpret results. In this work we critically revisit traffic classification by conducting a thorough evaluation of three classification approaches, based on transport layer ports, host behavior, and flow features. A strength of our work is the broad range of data against which we test the three classification approaches: seven traces with payload collected in Japan, Korea, and the US. The diverse geographic locations, link characteristics and application traffic mix in these data allowed us to evaluate the approaches under a wide variety of conditions. We analyze the advantages and limitations of each approach, evaluate methods to overcome the limitations, and extract insights and recommendations for both the study and practical application of traffic classification. We make our software, classifiers, and data available for researchers interested in validating or extending this work.},

  Abstract                 = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are integral components for the detection of malicious code and attacks. Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.},

  Abstract                 = {Application identification in the middle is one of key challenges for network operators to manage application based traffic and policy controls in the Internet. However, it is becoming harder according to the increase of end-to-end encrypted traffic in which we hardly read application specific information from packets. We previously proposed a method to identify the application of traffic whenever the traffic is encrypted or not. Our method gives a significant accuracy of identification of encrypted traffic as high as the case when traffic is not encrypted, however, it requires an offline processing to obtain statistics of the whole of flows. A real-time identification is important, but the accuracy is a problem due to unstable information of flow statistics. In this paper we therefore propose an approach to improve the accuracy of identification when we identify the encrypted traffic in real-time. We first clarify the sufficient number of packets required for accurate identification, and then the method to infer the statistics to improve the accuracy even when the obtained number of packets is smaller than the one required. Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach achieves the high accuracy almost the same as in offline method.},

The method uses machine learning and support vector machines in particular. The paper is written in very bad english and the experiments are often inconclusive. The important result is that the encryption affects some of the features more strongly than others.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of application flows is a critical task in order to manage bandwidth requirements of different kind of services (i.e. VOIP, Video, ERP). As network security functions spread, an increasing amount of traffic is natively encrypted due to privacy issues (e.g. VPN). This makes ineffective current traffic classification systems based on ports and payload inspection, e.g. even powerful Deep Packet Inspection is useless to classify application flow carried inside SSH sessions. We have developed a real time traffic classification method based on cluster analysis to identify SSH flows from statistical behavior of IP traffic parameters, such as length, arrival times and direction of packets. In this paper we describe our approach and relevant obtained results. We achieve detection rate up to 99.5 \% in classifying SSH flows and accuracy up to 99.88 \% for application flows carried within those flows, such as SCP, SFTP and HTTP over SSH.},

  Abstract                 = {Since its introduction in 1994 the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol (later renamed to Transport Layer Security (TLS)) evolved to the de facto standard for securing the transport layer. SSL/TLS can be used for ensuring data confidentiality, integrity and authenticity during transport. A main feature of the protocol is its flexibility. Modes of operation and security goals can easily be configured through different cipher suites.
This thesis focuses on the SSL/TLS protocol suites for secure communication over untrusted media (the internet). It explains the protcol in depth (in the – at the time of writing – most common version TLS 1.0), provides a brief summary on its evolution and gives a detailed chronology of attacks and attack categories. New techniques for fingerprinting particular SSL/TLS implementations (stacks), partially down to patch level, are introduced and implemented as a tool for SSL/TLS stack inspection.
Moreover, new attacks on state of the art implementations are given and a new framework, called T.I.M.E., especially designed for deep protocol inspection and penetration is presented. The attacks undermine the security goal confidentiality. Exploits for the discussed attacks are implemented by using the T.I.M.E framework. The results caused changes (fixes) in the affected implementations and highlight the need for tested, specification compliant and security optimized software.},

New work is emerging on the use of statistical traffic characteristics to assist in the identification and classification process. This survey paper looks at emerging research into the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to IP traffic classification - an inter-disciplinary blend of IP networking and data mining techniques. We provide context and motivation for the application of ML techniques to IP traffic classification, and review 18 significant works that cover the dominant period from 2004 to early 2007. These works are categorized and reviewed according to their choice of ML strategies and primary contributions to the literature. We also discuss a number of key requirements for the employment of ML-based traffic classifiers in operational IP networks, and qualitatively critique the extent to which the reviewed works meet these requirements. Open issues and challenges in the field are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Application identification is paid much attention by network operators to manage application based traffic control in the Internet. However, encryption is one of the factors to make application identification difficult, because it is so hard to infer the original (unencrypted) packets from encrypted packets. Therefore the accuracy of application identification is getting worse as the increase of encrypted traffic. In this paper, the changes in traffic features due to encryption are analyzed, and two methods are developed that can be used with an existing method for identifying applications from encrypted traffic. Experimental results show that these methods improve identification accuracy up to 28.5\% for encrypted traffic compared to existing methods. Moreover, identification using the best combination of flow features enables high accuracy with less computation due to the elimination of features that do not flow a Gaussian distribution and thus degrade accuracy.},

Then they evaluate which of 49 measured flow features are strongly correlated in normal and encrypted traffic. These features are used to infer functions to describe the relation between the features. The encrypted traffic is separated based on strongly distinct features. Using Naive Bayes classifier with inferred flow fetures on encrypted traffic improves accuracy of the method up to 28.5\%. Moreover, the paper shows that it is possible to recognize encrypted traffic based on flow features. However, this is true for encrypted tunnels, authors do not provide any information about per flow encryption (e.g. using TLS).},

In this paper, we propose a hybrid method that combines signature-based methods and statistical analysis methods to address this issue. We first identify SSL/TLS traffic with signature matching methods, and then apply statistical analysis to determine concrete application protocols. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is able to recognize over 99\% of SSL/TLS traffic and achieve 94.52\% in F-score for protocols identification.},

This presents a challenge for traffic measurement, especially for analysis and anomaly detection methods, which are dependent on the type of network traffic. In this paper, we survey existing approaches for classification and analysis of encrypted traffic. First, we describe the most widespread encryption protocols used throughout the Internet. We show that the initiation of an encrypted connection and the protocol structure give away much information for encrypted traffic classification and analysis. Then, we survey payload and feature-based classification methods for encrypted traffic and categorize them using an established taxonomy. The advantage of some of described classification methods is the ability to recognize the encrypted application protocol in addition to the encryption protocol. Finally, we make a comprehensive comparison of the surveyed feature-based classification methods and present their weaknesses and strengths.},

There are dedicated flow monitoring probes built with commodity hardware support up to 10G links, but multiple 10G or even 100 G optical networks are being used for transport networks and a data center connectivity. Running and maintaining many separate probes is uneconomical and time-consuming. Therefore, we explore the possibility to facilitate network interface cards (NICs) with multiple 10G interfaces to build probes which can replace many existing boxes, leading to reduced management and operational costs. The monitoring performance is critical for such a high-density solution. We use two custom-built, FPGA-based NICs, each with eight 10G interfaces to test current CPU limits and to propose improvements for the near future commodity NICs.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Internet traffic classification is a critical and essential functionality for network management and security systems. Due to the limitations of traditional port-based and payload-based classification approaches, the past several years have seen extensive research on utilizing machine learning techniques to classify Internet traffic based on packet and flow level characteristics. For the purpose of learning from unlabeled traffic data, some classic clustering methods have been applied in previous studies but the reported accuracy results are unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach for accurate Internet traffic clustering, which is motivated by the observation of widely existing partial equivalence relationships among Internet traffic flows. In particular, we formulate the problem using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with set-based equivalence constraint and propose a constrained Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for clustering. Experiments with real-world packet traces show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the quality of resultant traffic clusters. },

Prior works on traffic classification mainly focus their attentions on dividing Internet traffic into different categories based on application layer protocols (such as HTTP, Bit Torrent etc.). Making traffic classification from another point of view, we divide Internet traffic into different content types. Our technology is an attempt to solve the classification problem of network traffic, which contains unknown and proprietary protocols (i.e., no publicly available protocol specification). In this paper, we design a classifier which can distinguish Internet traffic into different content types using machine learning techniques. Features of our classifier are entropy of consecutive bytes and frequencies of characters. Our method is capable of classifying real-world traces into different content types (including Text, Picture, Audio, Video, Compressed, Base 64-encoded image, Base 64-encoded text and Encrypted). The chief features of our classifier are small computing space (about 1K Bytes) and high classification accuracy (about 81\%).},

  Abstract                 = {Several fundamental security mechanisms for restricting access to network resources rely on the ability of a reference monitor to inspect the contents of traffic as it traverses the network. However, with the increasing popularity of cryptographic protocols, the traditional means of inspecting packet contents to enforce security policies is no longer a viable approach as message contents are concealed by encryption. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which common application protocols can be identified using only the features that remain intact after encryption---namely packet size, timing, and direction. We first present what we believe to be the first exploratory look at protocol identification in encrypted tunnels which carry traffic from many TCP connections simultaneously, using only post-encryption observable features. We then explore the problem of protocol identification in individual encrypted TCP connections, using much less data than in other recent approaches. The results of our evaluation show that our classifiers achieve accuracy greater than 90\% for several protocols in aggregate traffic, and, for most protocols, greater than 80\% when making fine-grained classifications on single connections. Moreover, perhaps most surprisingly, we show that one can even estimate the number of live connections in certain classes of encrypted tunnels to within, on average, better than 20\%.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet, while emerging as the key component for all sorts of communication, is far from well-understood. The goal of traffic classification is to understand the type of traffic carried on the Internet, which continually evolves in scope and complexity. For security and privacy reasons, many applications have emerged that utilize obfuscation techniques such as random ports, encrypted data transmission, or proprietary communication protocols. Further, applications adapt rapidly in the face of attempts to detect certain types of traffic, creating a challenge for traffic classification schemes. Research papers on Internet traffic classification try to classify whatever traffic samples a researcher can find, with no systematic integration of results. With the exception of machine learning techniques for traffic classification, we know of no complete overview of traffic classification attempts. To fill this gap, we have created a structured taxonomy of traffic classification papers and their datasets. To illustrate its utility, we use the taxonomy to answer the recently most popular question about traffic (“How much is peer-to-peer file sharing?”). Our survey also reveals open issues and challenges in traffic classification.},

  Abstract                 = {Classification analysis of network traffic based on port number or payload is becoming increasingly difficult from security to quality of service measurements, because of using dynamic port numbers, masquerading and various cryptographic techniques to avoid detection. Research tends to analyze flow statistical features with machine learning techniques. Clustering approaches do not require complex training procedure and large memory cost. However, the performance of clustering algorithm like k-Means still have own disadvantages. We propose a novel approach of considering harmonic mean as distance matric, and evaluate it in terms of three metrics on real-world encrypted traffic. The result shows the classification has better performance compared with the previously.},
