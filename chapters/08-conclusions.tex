\section{Answers to Research Questions}

\section{Further Research}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 400\,Gbps and more, hardware acceleration, commodity systems
  \item Encryption - application of machine learning to flow monitoring
  \item Cloud - host based monitoring + logs
  \item Virtual environment - Open Flow - current hot topic
  \item React to demands of detection methods (flow processing systems) - study interactions between the systems
  \item ? Slim down the amount of information to a minimum, only a part of information is ever processed.
\end{itemize}

Concepts provided in the last chapter can help with the items above.

Traffic generation - we need synthetic and real-like traffic for testing of monitoring equipment. Synthetic is easy with Spirent and similar products, real-like not so much.
