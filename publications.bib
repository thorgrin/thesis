  Abstract                 = {Current approaches perform geolocation mostly on-demand and in a small-scale fashion. As soon as geolocation needs to be performed in real-time in high-speed and large-scale networks, these approaches are not scalable anymore. To solve this problem, we propose two approaches to large-scale geolocation. Firstly, we present an exporter-based approach, which adds geolocation data to flow records in a way that is transparent to any flow collector. Secondly, we present a flow collector-based approach, which adds native geolocation to NetFlow data from any flow exporter. After presenting prototypes for both approaches, we demonstrate the applicability of large-scale geolocation by means of use cases.},

  Abstract                 = {The exhaustion of IPv4 address space increases pressure on network operators and content providers to continue the transition to IPv6. The IPv6 transition mechanisms such as Teredo and 6to4 allow IPv4 hosts to connect to IPv6 hosts. On the other hand, they increase network complexity and render ineffective many methods to observe IP traffic. In this paper, we modified our flow-based measurement system to involve transition mechanisms information to provide full IPv6 visibility. Our traffic analysis focuses on IPv6 tunneled traffic and uses data collected over one week in the Czech national research and education network. The results expose various traffic characteristics of native and tunneled IPv6 traffic, among others the TTL and HOP limit distribution, geolocation aspect of the traffic, and list of Teredo servers used in the network. Furthermore, we show how the traffic of IPv6 transition mechanisms has evolved since 2010.},

  Abstract                 = {With a vastly different header format, IPv6 introduces new vulnerabilities not possible in IPv4, potentially requiring new detection algorithms. While many attacks specific to IPv6 have proven to be possible and are described in the literature, no detection solutions for these attacks have been proposed. In this study we identify and characterise IPv6-specific attacks that can be detected using flow monitoring. By constructing flow-based signatures, detection can be performed using available technologies such as NetFlow and IPFIX. To validate our approach, we implemented these signatures in a prototype, monitoring two production networks and injecting attacks into the production traffic.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of Extension Headers, newly introduced with IPv6, is elusive and enables new types of threats in the Internet. Simply dropping all traffic containing any Extension Header — a current practice by operators-seemingly is an effective solution, but at the cost of possibly dropping legitimate traffic as well. To determine whether threats indeed occur, and evaluate the actual nature of the traffic, measurement solutions need to be adapted. By implementing these specific parsing capabilities in flow exporters and performing measurements on two different production networks, we show it is feasible to quantify the metrics directly related to these threats, and thus allow for monitoring and detection. Analysing the traffic that is hidden behind Extension Headers, we find mostly benign traffic that directly affects end-user QoE: simply dropping all traffic containing Extension Headers is thus a bad practice with more consequences than operators might be aware of.},

In contrast to previously published analyses, we were the first to classify patterns of HTTP traffic which are relevant to network security. We described three classes of HTTP traffic which contain brute-force password attacks, connections to proxies, HTTP scanners, and web crawlers. Using the classification, we were able to detect up to 16 previously undetectable brute-force password attacks and 19 HTTP scans per day in our campus network. The activity of proxy servers and web crawlers was also observed. Symptoms of these attacks may be detected by other methods based on traditional flow monitoring, but detection using the analysis of HTTP requests is more straightforward. We, thus, confirm the added value of extended flow monitoring in comparison to the traditional method.},

  Abstract                 = {As the number of Internet applications grows, the number of applications that use data encapsulation increases as well. Flow monitoring using NetFlow version 5 or 9 is only able to analyze the encapsulating protocol, therefore it becomes too limited to detect new threats. For this reason, more thorough knowledge of such traffic is needed. The IPFIX protocol can be used in such situations, because it provides enough flexibility for monitoring tools to be extended by new elements. Along with greater flexibility, IPFIX support results in a higher performance footprint on collectors and tools for querying the collected data. Currently, there is a lack of flow collection frameworks with IPFIX support that would allow flow data to be extended. The aim of this paper is to compare open-source flow collectors that provide support for the IPFIX protocol. We focus on evaluating performance of query tools and the level of IPFIX support provided by the collection frameworks.},

We describe an architecture of the EventFlow extension and its limitations. A prototype implementation of the EventFlow is introduced and evaluated on a packet trace from an ISP network.

Although the DPI provides application visibility, detailed examination of every packet is computationally intensive. The IP flow monitoring achieves high performance by processing only packet headers, but provides less details about the traffic itself. Application-aware flow monitoring is proposed as an attempt to combine DPI accuracy and IP flow monitoring performance. However, the impacts, benefits and disadvantages of application flow monitoring have not been studied in detail yet. The work proposed in this paper attempts to rectify this lack of research. We also propose a next generation flow measurement for application monitoring. The flows will represent events within the application protocol, e.g., web page download, instead of packet stream. Finally, we will investigate the performance of different approaches to application classification and application parsing with a computational complexity in mind.},

In this paper, we survey existing approaches for classification and analysis of encrypted traffic. First, we describe the most widespread encryption protocols used throughout the Internet. We show that the initiation of an encrypted connection and the protocol structure give away much information for encrypted traffic classification and analysis. Then, we survey payload and feature-based classification methods for encrypted traffic and categorize them using an established taxonomy. The advantage of some of described classification methods is the ability to recognize the encrypted application protocol in addition to the encryption protocol. Finally, we make a comprehensive comparison of the surveyed feature-based classification methods and present their weaknesses and strengths.},

We show the packet rates achieved by respective parsers, including the throughput decrease (performance implications of application parser) which is of the utmost importance for high-speed deployments.

  Abstract                 = {Network monitoring has became a significant part of network management. Each environment and type of network have their specific, different needs. To allow network traffic monitoring in various environments, a necessity of flexible approach thus grows. The current generation of flow collectors provides only a limited flexibility, mainly due to limits of their data storage formats. Moreover, it is quite a challenging task to compare particular storage formats and their suitability for the specific environment and usage. In this paper we present IPFIXcol – a flow collector framework designed for easy data storage formats changing. This way, we plan to evaluate performance and suitability of various data storage formats for specific tasks. Results can be used to build the most appropriate data storage for the specific production environments.},

  Abstract                 = {Performing research on live network traffic requires the traffic to be well documented and described. The results of such research are heavily dependent on the particular network. This paper presents a study of network characteristics, which can be used to describe the behaviour of a network. We propose a number of characteristics that can be collected from the networks and evaluate them on five different networks of Masaryk University. The proposed characteristics cover IP, transport and application layers of the network traffic. Moreover, they reflect strong day-night and weekday patterns that are present in most of the networks. Variation in the characteristics between the networks indicates that they can be used for the description and differentiation of the networks. Furthermore, a weak correlation between the chosen characteristics implies their independence and contribution to network description.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring of high-speed networks is becoming a resource intensive task. There are dedicated flow monitoring probes built with commodity hardware support up to 10G links, but multiple 10G or even 100 G optical networks are being used for transport networks and a data center connectivity. Running and maintaining many separate probes is uneconomical and time-consuming. Therefore, we explore the possibility to facilitate network interface cards (NICs) with multiple 10G interfaces to build probes which can replace many existing boxes, leading to reduced management and operational costs. The monitoring performance is critical for such a high-density solution. We use two custom-built, FPGA-based NICs, each with eight 10G interfaces to test current CPU limits and to propose improvements for the near future commodity NICs.},
